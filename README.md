# ValutoPy
ValutoPy is the original Valuto desktop wallet. Written by We8Punk for use with the Valuto blockchain software. It should however, with few modifications work with most bitcoin derived cores.

NB... This repo contains highly experimental code. Do NOT use this in a production environment where real assets are in jeopardy. Use the installer linked on the official website(s) instead.

# So thunder and lightning there will be, if you only had a match!

If you go ahead and download this repo, set up all the dependencies and succesfully launch this software, you will quickly find out that ValutoPy is dependent on valutod, which you can download from:

# So what's TODO

A lot! :-)
